## neo4j Block configuration

To add the neo4j Block, add this service in your `docker-compose.yml`, as shown below.

```
  neo4j:
    image: bh.cr/marc6/neo4j-amd64
    ports:
      - "7474:7474"
      - "7687:7687"
    volumes:
      - neo4j-data:/data
      - neo4j-logs:/logs
    environment:
      - NEO4J_AUTH=< your username >/< your password >
    restart: always

volumes:
  neo4j-data:
  neo4j-logs:
```

At this moment you will have the neo4j graph database UI available on the port `7474`.
